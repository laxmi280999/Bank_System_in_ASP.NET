# Bank_System_in_ASP.NET
In this simple ASP.NET Banking Application, I have made use of Stored procedures as well as regular methods to perform CRUD opeartions

Points to Note:
1. Code-first Approach is used.
2. All the Customers-related CRUD operations are performed normally.
3. All Employee-related CRUD operations are performed using Stored Procedures.
4. For the purpose of stored procedures, LINQ to SQL classes have been used.
