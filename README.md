# Bank_System_in_ASP.NET
In this simple ASP.NET Banking Application, I have made use of Stored procedures as well as regular methods to perform CRUD opeartions. This is a very basic application mainly intended for trial of ASP.NET concepts and does not contain any complex operations.

Points to Note:
1. Code-first Approach is used.
2. All the Customers-related CRUD operations are performed normally.
3. All Employee-related CRUD operations are performed using Stored Procedures.
4. For the purpose of stored procedures, LINQ to SQL classes have been used.

Points to note on Import/Export of Excel data:
1. Import/Export options are available for Customers only.
2. Import of Excel data to View-only and not database.
3. Export of View table data to Excel using Javascript.
